1. A CentOS server is running slow. How would you diagnose and troubleshoot the issue?

To diagnose and troubleshoot a slow CentOS server, follow these steps systematically:
1. Check System Load & Resource Usage
   a.Check CPU Load
     uptime
     top -o %CPU
     htop  # If installed
     Look for high CPU usage processes.
     If the load average (first three numbers in uptime) is high, it indicates CPU bottlenecks.
   b.Check Memory Usage
    free -m
    vmstat 1 5
    Look at the "available" memory.
   If swap usage is high, the server may be struggling with RAM shortages.
  c.Check Disk I/O
    iostat -x 1 5  # Requires sysstat package
    iotop         # If installed
    df -h
    High I/O wait time (wa %) means disk contention.
    Use iotop to find I/O-intensive processes.
2. Check Running Processes
   ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10  # Top CPU-consuming processes
   ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10  # Top memory-consuming processes
   Identify any rogue or misbehaving processes.
3. Check Network Performance
   netstat -tunlp   # Show open ports and connections
   ss -tulwn        # Alternative to netstat
   ping -c 5 google.com  # Check internet connectivity
   High network connections may indicate DDoS attacks or misconfigured services.
   Check for excessive TCP connections.
4. Identify Zombie or Defunct Processes
   ps aux | grep Z
   If many zombie processes exist, they may be slowing down the system.
5. Check Logs for Errors
   journalctl -xe
   dmesg -T | tail -50
   cat /var/log/messages | tail -50
   Look for disk failures, OOM (Out of Memory) errors, or service crashes.
6. Check System Temperature
   sensors  # If lm_sensors is installed
   Overheating can throttle the CPU.
7. Verify Running Services
   systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
   Ensure unnecessary services are not consuming resources.
8. Check SELinux & Firewall Issues
   sestatus
   iptables -L -n -v
   Misconfigured SELinux can cause performance issues.
9. Check for High Swap Usage
   swapon -s
   If swap is heavily used, increase RAM or optimize memory usage.
10. Check for Failing Disks (SMART)
  smartctl -a /dev/sda  # Requires smartmontools
  Look for reallocated sectors or CRC errors.
11. Optimize Performance
  Clear Cache
  sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
  Restart Services or Reboot
  systemctl restart <service>
  reboot
12. Long-Term Fixes
  Upgrade hardware (RAM, CPU, Disk) if overloaded.
  Disable unused services (systemctl disable <service>)
  Optimize application/database queries if they are causing high CPU/Memory usage.
  Set up monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix) to track resource utilization.






2. You are unable to SSH into a CentOS server. How would you resolve this problem?


3. A service is failing to start after a reboot. How would you debug and fix it?


4. You need to add a new disk to a CentOS system. How would you partition, format, and mount it?


5. A user accidentally deleted important system files. How would you recover or restore them?


6. The /var directory is full, causing application failures. How would you free up space?


7. You need to upgrade the kernel on a CentOS server. How would you safely perform this?


8. A firewall is blocking access to a specific port. How would you check and modify firewall rules?


9. The system is stuck in emergency mode after a reboot. How would you troubleshoot and fix it?


10. You need to automate the installation of software on multiple CentOS servers. What approach would you take?


11. A user complains that their cron job is not executing. How would you investigate and resolve this?


12. A critical application is crashing due to memory issues. How would you analyze and fix this?


13. A network interface is down after a reboot. How would you bring it back up permanently?


14. You need to set up a secure SFTP-only user account on CentOS. How would you configure this?


15. A log file is growing too fast, consuming disk space. How would you manage and rotate logs efficiently?


16. You suspect that SELinux is blocking an application. How would you verify and fix the issue?


17. A new software package dependency is missing. How would you install it without breaking the system?


18. The system time is incorrect. How would you sync it with an NTP server?


19. A user needs to run a script with root privileges but without full root access. How would you configure this securely?


20. You need to migrate a CentOS server to a new machine. What steps would you take to ensure a smooth migration?
